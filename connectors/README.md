# Connectors: Integration with Noosphere

The **connectors** folder contains pre-built modules and templates to integrate Noosphere with various backend services and databases. These connectors simplify the process of adding new backends to the Noosphere middleware, enabling seamless and modular integrations.

---

## What Are Connectors?
Connectors are modular plugins that allow the Noosphere middleware to communicate with different backend systems. Each connector handles:
- Request forwarding from Noosphere.
- Response processing from the backend.
- Optional transformations to normalize data formats.

```

## How to Use Connectors

### 1. Select an Existing Connector
If a pre-built connector exists for your backend technology (e.g., Flask or Express.js), follow its setup instructions:
- Flask: Use `flask_connector`.
- Express.js: Use `express_connector`.

### 2. Customize the Connector
1. Navigate to the desired connector folder.
2. Edit the configuration file (if applicable) to specify backend-specific details such as:
   - Backend URL
   - API routes
   - Authentication tokens

### 3. Add the Connector to the Middleware
Update the `backends` configuration in `core/index.js` to include the new backend:
```javascript
const backends = {
    analytics: 'http://localhost:5000',
    chat: 'http://localhost:3000',
    customBackend: 'http://localhost:7000'
};
```

### 4. Restart the Middleware
Restart the Noosphere middleware to apply the new connector configuration:
```bash
node index.js
```

## Creating a New Connector

### Step 1: Copy the Template
1. Navigate to the `connectors/template` folder.
2. Copy the template:
   ```bash
   cp -r connectors/template connectors/my_new_connector
   ```

### Step 2: Implement the Connector
1. Open the copied folder.
2. Modify the connector script to handle:
   - Request forwarding.
   - Response handling.
   - Any required transformations.

### Step 3: Register the Connector
1. Add the connector URL to the `backends` configuration in `core/index.js`.
2. Restart the middleware.

## Examples

### Flask Connector
**Purpose**: Integrates Flask-based backends with Noosphere.
- **Location**: `connectors/flask_connector`
- **Setup**:
  1. Update the Flask server URL in the connector configuration.
  2. Add the Flask backend to `core/index.js`:
     ```javascript
     const backends = {
         flaskService: 'http://localhost:6000'
     };
     ```

### Express Connector
**Purpose**: Integrates Express.js-based backends with Noosphere.
- **Location**: `connectors/express_connector`
- **Setup**:
  1. Update the Express server URL in the connector configuration.
  2. Add the Express backend to `core/index.js`:
     ```javascript
     const backends = {
         expressService: 'http://localhost:7000'
     };
     ```

## Best Practices for Connectors
- **Modularity**: Ensure each connector handles only one backend type.
- **Scalability**: Use environment variables to configure connector-specific details.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test each connector before deploying it.
